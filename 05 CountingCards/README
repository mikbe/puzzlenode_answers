Run instruction:

From a command prompt type:
ruby runme.rb

Output will be in the solution.txt file.

If you wish to run the script with something other than the 
default files you may specify them on the command line as well.

ruby runme.rb [game data file] [output file]

Command line parameters may be given partially but must be given in order,
that is to say if you want to give an output file you must give a game data
file but if you just want to give an game data file the default output file
name will be used (solution.txt).

Default values:

game data file  - "INPUT.txt"
ouput file      - "solution.txt"

Notes:
I didn't include this as one of my two entries because the code if fairly ugly
and isn't very well refactored. I was afraid I might not have enough time to
get my submissions in before all the slots were taken so I cleaned it up a
little but it's really ugly and is more of a kludge of a solution than a 
well designed one.

Hopefully including this will show how much I need the course and am willing
to work if allowed to participate.
