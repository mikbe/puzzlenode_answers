Run instruction:

From a command prompt type:
ruby runme.rb

Output will be in the solution.txt file.

If you wish to run the script with something other than the 
default files you may specify them on the command line as well.

ruby runme.rb [input file] [output file]

Command line parameters may be given partially but must be given in order,
that is to say if you want to give an output file you must give an input
file but if you just want to give an input file the default output file
name will be used.

Default values:

input file - "INPUT.json"
ouput file - "solution.txt"

Notes:
If you do not have the JSON gem installed a simplified JSON parser I wrote will be used.
It's not a great parser it's just enough to get the job done.
