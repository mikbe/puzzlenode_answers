Run instruction:

From a command prompt type:
ruby runme.rb

Output will be in the solution.txt file.

If you wish to run the script with something other than the 
default files you may specify them on the command line as well.

ruby runme.rb  [rental rates file], [dates file], [output file], [TAX_RATE]

Command line parameters may be given partially but must be given in order,
that is to say if you want to give an output file you must also give a 
rental rates file and dates file and the default tax rate will be used.

If you just want to give a rental rates file the default dates file, 
output file, and tax rate will be used.

Default values:

rental rates file - "INPUT.json"
dates file        - "input.txt"
output file       - "solution.txt"
Tax rate          - 1.0411416

Notes:
If you do not have the JSON gem installed a simplified JSON parser I wrote will be used.
It's not a great parser it's just enough to get the job done.

I went a overboard on this one and separated the controller logic from the model logic.
It's overkill and premature optimization but I was using it as an exercise to practice a little MVC.
